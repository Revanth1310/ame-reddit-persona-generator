*   **Maintaining a sense of order and fairness:** He seems bothered by what he perceives as excessive displays of authority or status, finding the sticker culture in Lucknow unusual and potentially pretentious. (Posts: "Born and raised in Delhi - I shifted to LKO in Dec 24 for business purposes.

(Posts: "[lucknow] Productive weekend activities in LKO?", Comments: "[lucknow] A menu easy to cook/process - healthy and quick.")

*   **Reflects on differences between Delhi and Lucknow:** Compares and contrasts his experiences in both cities, particularly regarding societal norms and behaviors. (Posts: "Born and raised in Delhi - I shifted to LKO in Dec 24 for business purposes." Comments: "[lucknow] Haha Delhi is hateable too but mostly those are HR or UP14 NCR vehicle. Plus the percentage of vehicles of such sort is low.")

**Frustrations:**

*   **Poor quality food:** Disappointed by the low quality and deceptive practices (like using palm oil) in food services. (Comments: "[lucknow] Same problem. I started eating power meals at home atleast saves me from crap quality. I even purchased a 250 per meal tiffin and it had palm oil!!!")
*   **Local corruption/bribery:** Annoyed by the perceived prevalence of bribery and informal systems of influence in local law enforcement, as witnessed in Nagpur. (Comments: "[nagpur] I was caught without helmet and license (close to my home). Cops outright wanted to fine me, but a 'common guy' came in and discussed bribe on my behalf with cops. I gave him 200rs (back in 2011) and Cops let me go.")
*   **Sense of displacement:** Still adjusting to the cultural norms of Lucknow after moving from Delhi. He seems to be experiencing a degree of culture shock, particularly concerning the sticker culture. (Posts: "Born and raised in Delhi - I shifted to LKO in Dec 24 for business purposes.")
*   **Perceived arrogance or flaunting of status:** Finds the ubiquity of stickers displaying official affiliations or titles on cars in Lucknow to be excessive and potentially indicative of a culture of showing off. (Posts: "Born and raised in Delhi - I shifted to LKO in Dec 24 for business purposes.")
